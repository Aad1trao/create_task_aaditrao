# My Create Task - Aadit Rao
AP CSP Create Performance Task
## Introduction
My create task is a game, a lot like Where's Waldo but with 4 levels. The levels get harder as you progress. I added a How to Play Page apart from the game to tell you how it works. I added lives incase you don't click on the item itself. That in fact was the hardest part for my code where I woud have to reset the lives for each level but trying to write the least amount of code for it as well.
